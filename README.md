# Conservative phlebotomy for reducing blood transfusions

A living systematic review

**Clinical summary:** This meta-analysis suggests that conservative phlebotomy *pending* effective at reducing transufusions due to iatrogenic anemia. The heterogenteity as measured by I2 was '[pending](http://handbook.cochrane.org/chapter_9/9_5_2_identifying_and_measuring_heterogeneity.htm)' at xx%.

**Methods overview:** This repository is an [openMetaAnalysis](https://openmetaanalysis.github.io/) that updates a previously published meta-analysis.(1) Newer studies included are listed in the references below. Rationale for newer trials excluded may be listed at the end of the references. 

This repository is a limited review and contains outcomes data only without PICO and Risk of Bias Tables.  This review does not include a GRADE Profile or Summary of Findings Table.

See [methods](http://openmetaanalysis.github.io/methods.html) for details.
